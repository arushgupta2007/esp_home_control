### Zero Cross Detection
AC Current is a sine wave ranging from x to -x, when the current is zero it is called *ZERO CROSSING*. If we can control a switch very fast(~ 10ms) to cut the sine wave, we can control the power. The Triac will be a suitable component to do so. After we detect the zero crossing, we give a delay of 2000 microsenconds to 9000 microseconds then fire the triac, we can cut the sinwave accurately.

 To Detect Zero Crossing we will use a Full bridge Rectifier, PC817 optocoupler, 2 33k ohm ressistors and the D2 pin of the NodeMCU.
 
 Here is the scematics:

 And Code:
 
 ```C
 void setup() {
  Serial.begin(115200);
  pinMode(D2, INPUT);
  attachInterrupt(digitalPinToInterrupt(D2), zcd, FALLING);
}

void loop() {
}

void zcd() {
  Serial.println("Now");
}
 ```
 
The input at D2 will be a trapezoidal wave (DC) with peak value of the voltage given to PIN4 at PC817, in this case it is 3.3v . We detect the LOW value using NodeMCU then Serial.println("NOW"). It should happen 100 times a second. 🎉 Zero Cross Detection is over.
